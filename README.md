**Free, Open-Source Emailing System for Blind**

## About
   The project is a `python-based` application for visually impaired persons using speech to text voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform all the other useful tasks. The system will prompt the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same. The main benefit of this system is that the use of mouse is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice and keyboard click only.
   
## Features
* Send email via voice.
* Fetch unseen emails.
* Count number of unseen emails.

## Modification
 - Just add your desktop directory in code where I have used `path` words in several lines. If you don't know your desktop directory then just open `terminal` or `command prompt` and paste the below code. Like: `C:\Users\sayak\Desktop` (this is my desktop directory).
 
   ```%userprofile%\Desktop```

## Installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Avbin
 - In some system, it requires avbin so keep it as it is. Don't delete this.
 - If your system needs this then just uncomment line number 13 & 14 in the code.
 - For more info have a look on this [AVbin](https://github.com/AVbin/AVbin)
 - For download manually [AVbin](http://avbin.github.io/AVbin/Download.html)

## Pyaudio
 - Select your achitecture & Download [Pyaudio](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) from this link.
 - Open the terminal where you have kept your `.whl` file and add the following command in terminal.

   ``` pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl```  
   
## Usage
 ```python3 voice_based_email_for_blind.py ```
